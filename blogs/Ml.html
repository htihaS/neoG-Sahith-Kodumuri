            <strong>Taste of Machine Learning</strong><br>
            Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence, coined the term "Machine Learning" in 1959.
            Over the past two decades Machine Learning has become one of the mainstays of information technology. 
            With the ever-increasing amounts of data becoming available there is good reason to believe that smart data analysis will become even more pervasive as a necessary ingredient for technological progress.
